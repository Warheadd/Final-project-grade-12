      <p>Carbon Tracker is an app to help track your carbon footprint. Every day, you can enter information about what you did and at the end of the day, it will display your carbon footprint as well as personalized advice on how to improve. You can figure out how much carbon you are emitting, compare yourself to averages, and track your progress over time.</p>
      <p>Every day, you can click "Start new day" and start entering information. The information is all sorted in categories like transportation and food. Explore all the categories and enter all the relevant information. Then, when you're done, you can submit your day and view the review. This will show you what your carbon footprint is, how you compare to national averages, how you compare to your past days, and what you can do to improve. The advice is all personalized, tailored to how YOU can make the biggest impact. Take the advice to heart and try to improve on the next day!</p>
      <p>Before you start, you will have to make a profile. This helps us store some relevant information so you don't have to enter it every day, such as what province you live in. At any point, you can click the profile icon to edit this information.</p>
      <p>If you want to see what you entered in past days, you can click the profile icon and go to "Edit history", which will allow you to see and edit all your past days.</p>
